Мне срочно нужен новый год!


Christmas Saves The Year

Snow falls down from the gray sky
Ashes fall in the sea
Plans are thrown to the wayside
Frozen days of the week

But everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumbling down
'Cause everybody's got
Somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap decor and flavored cheer
You rest assured, Christmas saves the year

Dust off old photo boxes
This one's marked "'92"
(Yeah)
Years past seemed so much grander
This one needs to come through

'Cause everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumbling down
'Cause everybody's got
Somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap decor and flavored cheer
You rest assured that Christmas saves the year

Bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum
Ba-da-bum
Bum, bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum

Everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumbling down
'Cause everybody's got
Somebody who's got their name on a shelf
With cheap decor and flavored cheer
You rest assured

Everybody wants to make it home this year
Even if the world is crumbling down
'Cause everybody's got
Somebody who's got their name on a shelf
